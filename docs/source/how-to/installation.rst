How do I install glue genes?
############################

You can install glue genes as a Python package.

We recommend installing into a dedicated virtual environment using conda::

    conda create -n glue-genes-env
    conda activate glue-genes-env

    conda install -c conda-forge glue-core
    pip install glue-genes

This process uses conda to get some of the difficult-to-install dependencies
for glue set up first.
