The glue-jax meta-package
========================

This package does not contain any code, but instead is a meta-package that 
depends on the core glue code as well as plugins for genomic analysis to be 
installed by default.

This currently installs:

* `glue-core <https://github.com/glue-viz/glue>`_, the main glue package
* `glue-vispy-viewers <https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-vispy-viewers>`_,
  which adds 3D viewers
